# It's for a book club

Some of my coworkers from [Sep](http://www.sep.com) and I are working on a book club for [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com).  There are two implementations of the exercises, one in traditional ANSI Lisp targeting the CLisp runtime and a second targeting the Clojure runtime.

# Week 1 Schedule

The reading for week 1 is Chapters 1 - 3.
