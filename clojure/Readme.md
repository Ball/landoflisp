# Examples in Clojure

The examples here are the projects and exercises from the [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com) written targeting the Clojure environment.

Clojure has different syntax and libraries so this will not quite be a one for one conversion.  I will attempt a literal conversion then try to write it in a more idiomatic fashion.

1. [guess.clj](guess.clj)
