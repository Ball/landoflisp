# Examples in Racket

The examples here are the projects and exercises from the [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com) written targeting the Racket language.

Racket is a scheme with different syntax and libraries so this will not quite be a one for one conversion.  I will attempt a literal conversion then try to write it in a more idiomatic fashion.
